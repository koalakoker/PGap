Notes are organized in pages and it is possible to setup a main <i>password</i> to get the access to the notes. When the notes are password protected the .ogp file in which the notes are stored will be encrypted.<br>OGapp is cross platform and is available for Windows, Linux and (maybe in the future) Mac. It is based on Qt4 and is written in C++.</u><br><br>This software is <b>OPEN SOURCE and <i>releas<u>ed</i> und</u>er GPL license so you c</b>an feel FREE to use, copy, share, (but above all) to study, analyze and modify it as you like (within the terms of the license).<br>If you like, hate or simply use this software, if you find any bug or have any request, please do not hesitate to let me know through the services offered by the site that hosts the project or through my Facebook page (http://facebook.com/koalakoker ).
